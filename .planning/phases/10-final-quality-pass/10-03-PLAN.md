<objective>
Create final verification document, run all quality checks, and update project state to reflect milestone completion.

Purpose: This plan produces the definitive evidence that all Phase 10 success criteria are met, closes the project state, and marks the ROADMAP as fully complete. It runs after test fixes and requirements update are done.

Output: 10-VERIFICATION.md with evidence, updated STATE.md, updated ROADMAP.md.

  <name>Task 1: Run all quality checks and create 10-VERIFICATION.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-final-quality-pass/10-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Run all quality validation commands and create `10-VERIFICATION.md` documenting evidence for each Phase 10 success criterion.

**Run these commands and capture output:**

1. `cd "/Users/karsten/NextCore/Core - Idrett/app" && flutter analyze 2>&1` — capture issue count
2. `cd "/Users/karsten/NextCore/Core - Idrett/backend" && dart analyze 2>&1` — capture issue count
3. `cd "/Users/karsten/NextCore/Core - Idrett/backend" && dart test 2>&1` — capture pass/fail count
4. `cd "/Users/karsten/NextCore/Core - Idrett/app" && flutter test 2>&1` — capture pass/fail count

**Create `10-VERIFICATION.md` with this structure:**

```markdown
# Phase 10: Final Quality Pass — Verification

**Verified:** 2026-02-10
**Verifier:** Claude (automated)

## Success Criteria Results

### 1. Flutter analyze: zero errors, only accepted warnings
- **Result:** PASS / FAIL
- **Evidence:** [issue count] issues found. [list only the accepted ones]
- **Accepted warnings:** [list the 5 known pre-existing warnings]

### 2. Dart analyze backend: zero errors, zero warnings
- **Result:** PASS / FAIL
- **Evidence:** [exact output]

### 3. All backend tests pass
- **Result:** PASS / FAIL
- **Evidence:** [test count] tests, [pass count] passing, [fail count] failing

### 4. All frontend tests pass
- **Result:** PASS / FAIL
- **Evidence:** [test count] tests, [pass count] passing, [fail count] failing

### 5. Requirements coverage
- **Result:** PASS / FAIL
- **Evidence:** All 45 v1 requirements marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md
- **Breakdown:** [summary by category]

### 6. Manual smoke test
- **Result:** DEFERRED (requires human testing with running app)
- **Note:** Smoke test checklist provided in 10-RESEARCH.md for future human execution

## Overall Result

**Status:** [PASS if criteria 1-5 pass, PARTIAL if any fail]
**Note:** Criterion 6 (manual smoke test) requires human execution with a running app instance and is deferred to the user.

## Summary

[Brief paragraph summarizing the final state of the codebase quality]

If any criterion FAILS, document what failed and why. Do not fabricate results.

  <action>
Update project tracking documents to reflect Phase 10 completion and overall milestone closure.

**STATE.md updates:**
1. Change "Current focus" to: "Phase 10 - Final Quality Pass (complete)"
2. Change "Current Position" to: Phase 10 of 10 (Final Quality Pass), Plan 3 of 3, Status: Complete
3. Update progress bar to 100% (30 of 30 total plans across phases 01-10)
4. Add Phase 10 velocity data to the Performance Metrics table
5. Update "Last activity" to current date with Phase 10 completion note
6. Change "Next" in Session Continuity to "Milestone complete — maintenance mode"
7. Remove "8 pre-existing frontend widget test failures" from Blockers/Concerns (they are now fixed)

**ROADMAP.md updates:**
1. Change Phase 10 checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
2. Add completion date: `✓ (2026-02-10)`
3. Update Phase 10 "Plans" count: `**Plans:** 3 plans`
4. Update Phase 10 plan list with actual plan descriptions
5. Update Progress table: Phase 10 row shows `3/3 | ✓ Complete | 2026-02-10`
6. Update "Plans: TBD" to actual plan list
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read STATE.md — shows Phase 10 complete, 30/30 plans
2. Read ROADMAP.md — all 10 phases marked `[x]`, Phase 10 shows 3/3 complete
  </verify>
  <done>STATE.md reflects project completion (30/30 plans, Phase 10 complete). ROADMAP.md shows all 10 phases complete with dates. Project milestone officially closed.</done>
