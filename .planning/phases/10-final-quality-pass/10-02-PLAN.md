<objective>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md to mark all 45 v1 requirements as complete with evidence references from their respective phases.

Purpose: The REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table was not updated during Phases 4-9 execution. Many requirements are marked "Pending" despite being completed. This plan reconciles the documentation with the actual state of the codebase, ensuring accurate project closure.

Output: REQUIREMENTS.md with all 45 requirements marked complete with phase evidence.

  <name>Task 1: Update REQUIREMENTS.md with completion evidence for all 45 requirements</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Update `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` to reflect the actual completion status of all 45 v1 requirements. The research confirmed that ALL requirements have been completed across Phases 1-9, but the file was not updated after Phase 3.

**Requirements already marked complete (keep as-is):**
- TEST-01, TEST-02 (Phase 1)
- TYPE-01 through TYPE-06 (Phase 2)
- BSPLIT-01 through BSPLIT-08 (Phase 3)

**Requirements to mark complete with evidence:**

1. **FSPLIT-01 through FSPLIT-08** — All completed in Phase 5
   - FSPLIT-01: message_widgets.dart split into barrel with 4 focused files (Phase 5, Plan 05-01)
   - FSPLIT-02: test_detail_screen.dart reduced from 476 to 211 LOC (Phase 5, Plan 05-01)
   - FSPLIT-03: export_screen.dart reduced from 470 to 219 LOC (Phase 5, Plan 05-02)
   - FSPLIT-04: activity_detail_screen.dart reduced from 456 to 178 LOC (Phase 5, Plan 05-02)
   - FSPLIT-05: mini_activity_detail_content.dart reduced to 307 LOC (Phase 5, Plan 05-03)
   - FSPLIT-06: stats_widgets.dart converted to barrel with 3 files (Phase 5, Plan 05-03)
   - FSPLIT-07: edit_team_members_tab.dart reduced from 423 to 88 LOC (Phase 5, Plan 05-03)
   - FSPLIT-08: dashboard_info_widgets.dart converted to barrel with 4 files (Phase 5, Plan 05-03)

2. **TEST-03 through TEST-08** — All completed in Phase 6
   - TEST-03: Export service tests with 5 export types (Phase 6, Plan 06-01, 54 tests)
   - TEST-04: Tournament bracket generation tests (Phase 6, Plan 06-02, 39 tests)
   - TEST-05: Fine service payment reconciliation tests (Phase 6, Plan 06-02)
   - TEST-06: Statistics service edge case tests (Phase 6, Plan 06-01)
   - TEST-07: Frontend export screen widget tests (Phase 6, Plan 06-03, 14 tests)
   - TEST-08: Frontend tournament screen widget tests (Phase 6, Plan 06-03)

3. **SEC-01 through SEC-03, SEC-07** — All completed in Phase 4
   - SEC-01: isAdmin() consolidated to user_is_admin flag (Phase 4, Plan 04-01)
   - SEC-02: Rate limiting on auth endpoints 5 req/min (Phase 4, Plan 04-02)
   - SEC-03: Rate limiting on mutation endpoints 30 req/min (Phase 4, Plan 04-02)
   - SEC-07: isFinesManager() enforced on fine mutations (Phase 4, Plan 04-01)

4. **SEC-04 through SEC-06** — All completed in Phase 8
   - SEC-04: FCM retry with exponential backoff 8 attempts (Phase 8, Plan 08-02)
   - SEC-05: Token persisted with timestamp in FlutterSecureStorage (Phase 8, Plan 08-02)
   - SEC-06: Foreground notifications via flutter_local_notifications (Phase 8, Plan 08-03)

5. **CONS-01 through CONS-06** — All completed in Phase 7
   - CONS-01: 32 handlers standardized auth pattern (Phase 7, Plan 07-01)
   - CONS-02: Norwegian error messages verified across all handlers (Phase 7, Plan 07-01)
   - CONS-03: when2() + EmptyStateWidget used consistently (Phase 7, Plan 07-04 + prior)
   - CONS-04: ErrorDisplayService migration in 33 files (Phase 7, Plan 07-03)
   - CONS-05: Response shapes standardized (Phase 7 + prior)
   - CONS-06: AppSpacing constants + EmptyStateWidget standardization (Phase 7, Plan 07-04)

6. **I18N-01 through I18N-03** — All completed in Phase 9
   - I18N-01: All UI labels/buttons/headers in Norwegian (Phase 9, Plans 09-01 + 09-03)
   - I18N-02: All error messages in Norwegian (Phase 9, Plan 09-01)
   - I18N-03: All placeholder text in Norwegian (Phase 9, Plan 09-01)

**Update format for each requirement:**
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Add `✓ Phase N` at end

**Update traceability table:**
- Change all `Pending` to `✓ Complete` in Status column

**Update coverage summary at bottom:**
- Change to: `45 total, 45 Complete, 0 Pending (100% coverage)`

**Update the `Last updated` date to current date (2026-02-10).**

  <verify>
Read the updated REQUIREMENTS.md and verify:
1. All 45 requirements have `[x]` checkmarks
2. All traceability table entries show `✓ Complete`
3. Coverage summary shows 100%
4. No requirement is missing evidence reference
  </verify>
  <done>All 45 v1 requirements marked complete with evidence references. Traceability table shows 100% completion. No "Pending" entries remain.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Grep for `- [ ]` in REQUIREMENTS.md v1 section — should find 0 matches
2. Grep for `Pending` in traceability table — should find 0 matches
3. Count `- [x]` entries — should be exactly 45
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All 45 v1 requirements marked as complete with phase evidence
- Traceability table shows 45/45 complete
- File reflects accurate project completion state
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-final-quality-pass/10-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
