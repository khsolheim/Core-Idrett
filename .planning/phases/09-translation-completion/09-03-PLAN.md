<objective>
Fix 4 remaining English strings found during phase verification that block the phase goal of zero English in user-facing UI.

Purpose: Close verification gaps — 4 confirmed English strings remain after plans 09-01 and 09-02. Items 'Start' and 'Pause' in stopwatch_display.dart are valid Norwegian words (identical in both languages) and are NOT gaps.
Output: All 4 English strings translated to Norwegian; grep verification passes.

  <name>Task 1: Translate 4 remaining English UI strings to Norwegian</name>

  <action>
    Make these 4 exact string replacements (literal-only, no code changes):

    1. **admin_actions_section.dart line 38**: Change `'Admin'` to `'Administrator'`
       - This is the section title in the activity admin actions widget
       - The profile_screen.dart was already fixed to 'Administrator' in plan 09-01, but this instance was missed

    2. **achievements_screen.dart line 52**: Change `Tab(text: 'Team'` to `Tab(text: 'Lag'`
       - This is the third tab in the achievements TabBar
       - 'Lag' is standard Norwegian for 'Team' in sports context

    3. **leaderboard_screen.dart line 28**: Change `'Total'` to `'Totalt'`
       - This is the first category tuple in the _categories list
       - 'Totalt' is the correct Norwegian neuter adjective form (modifying implied noun)

    4. **tournament_screen.dart line 105**: Change `Tab(text: 'Bracket')` to `Tab(text: 'Kamptre')`
       - This is the first tab in the tournament TabBar
       - 'Kamptre' (match tree) is the Norwegian term for tournament bracket
       - Alternative: 'Sluttspill' (playoff bracket) — prefer 'Kamptre' as it directly describes the bracket structure

    **Do NOT change** 'Start' or 'Pause' in stopwatch_display.dart — these are identical in Norwegian and are not gaps.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run these verification commands:

    1. `cd app && flutter analyze` — zero new errors
    2. `grep -n "'Admin'" lib/features/activities/presentation/widgets/admin_actions_section.dart` — should return zero results
    3. `grep -n "text: 'Team'" lib/features/achievements/presentation/achievements_screen.dart` — should return zero results
    4. `grep -n "'Total'" lib/features/statistics/presentation/leaderboard_screen.dart` — should return zero results
    5. `grep -n "text: 'Bracket'" lib/features/mini_activities/presentation/screens/tournament_screen.dart` — should return zero results
    6. Confirm 'Start' and 'Pause' in stopwatch_display.dart are UNCHANGED (they are valid Norwegian)
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 4 English strings replaced with Norwegian equivalents. Flutter analyze shows zero new errors. Grep confirms zero remaining English strings in the 4 target files. Phase 09 verification gaps fully closed.
  </done>

1. `cd app && flutter analyze` — zero new errors (only pre-existing info-level warnings)
2. Comprehensive grep for common English UI words in lib/features:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "'Admin'" lib/features/ --include="*.dart" | grep -v "import\|class\|Provider\|//\|admin_\|isAdmin\|Administrator"
   ```
   Should return zero results.
3. `grep -rn "Tab(text: 'Team'" lib/features/ --include="*.dart"` — zero results
4. `grep -rn "'Total'" lib/features/statistics/ --include="*.dart"` — zero user-facing results
5. `grep -rn "Tab(text: 'Bracket'" lib/features/ --include="*.dart"` — zero results
6. Confirm stopwatch_display.dart still has 'Start' and 'Pause' unchanged (valid Norwegian)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero English strings remain in the 4 target files
- Flutter analyze passes with no new errors
- All phase 09 verification gaps closed (4/4 confirmed gaps fixed, 2/2 non-gaps confirmed as valid Norwegian)
- Phase 09 success criteria #5 satisfied: grep search for common English UI words returns zero results in lib/features
</success_criteria>
